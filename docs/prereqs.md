# Skype Bots Workshop - Prerequisites

Please review this list *before* the workshop to avoid disappointment on the day. It's probably a good idea to download any needed files at home/work to reduce strain on the King's Centre WiFi.

Is this workshop for you?
------------
You should be a competent .NET programmer, although decent programmers from similar languages will likely do just fine. You should be comfortable in Visual Studio and understand how to work with REST APIs. You don't need to know anything about Azure or the Bot Framework.


Installed already on your laptop:
------------
* Windows : some of the code templates won't work cleanly with Macs and I've not tested things like the emulator with Mac. You're welcome to attend anyway and either try and get through it, or pair up with a Windows user for the morning and we'll work it out as best we can.
* Visual Studio (TODO: link, once tested with community)
* [Postman extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en)
  * Alternatively, [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) is a good substitute to Postman if you don't have Chrome.
* [Skype Consumer Client](https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/) - and make sure you've registered etc.
  
Downloaded but not installed (we'll cover installation steps in the workshop):
------------
* [Bot Template](aka.ms/bf-bc-vstemplate)
* [Bot Channel Emulator](aka.ms/bf-bc-emulator)



Finally, and importantly: make sure you have signed up to Azure:
------------
* Goto [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/)
* Walk through the registration process. You will need to supply a valid credit card, but it won't be charged unless you choose to alter the default payment settings.
* Make a note of your Azure login details as we will be using them during the workshop.
