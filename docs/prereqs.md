# Skype Bots Workshop - Prerequisites

__Please review this list *before* the workshop to avoid disappointment on the day.__ 

It's probably a good idea to download any needed files at home/work to reduce strain on the King's Centre WiFi.

Is this workshop for you?
------------
You should be a competent .NET programmer, although decent programmers from similar languages will likely do just fine. It will help if you are comfortable in Visual Studio and understand how to work with REST APIs. You don't need to know anything about Azure or the Bot Framework.

Installed already on your laptop:
------------
* __Windows__ : some of the code templates won't work cleanly with Macs and I've not tested things like the emulator with Mac. You're welcome to attend anyway and either try and get through it, or pair up with a Windows user for the morning and we'll work it out as best we can.
* __A web browswer__ : Chrome is a good pick as it works with Postman (below) but any major browser should be fine.
* __Visual Studio__ : if you don't already have this you can download the free Visual Studio Community from https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/
* __A HTTP tracer__ : such as [Postman extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en)
  * Alternatively, [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) is a good substitute to Postman if you don't have Chrome, or you can use anything which allows you to monitor and work with HTTP calls.
* __Skype__ (to test your bot) if you don't have this already download the [Skype Consumer Client for PC](https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/), or download to your mobile - and make sure you've registered etc.
  
  
Downloaded but not installed (we'll cover installation steps in the workshop):
------------
* [Bot Template](aka.ms/bf-bc-vstemplate)
* [Bot Channel Emulator](https://emulator.botframework.com/)


Finally, and importantly: make sure you have a valid Azure account.
------------

If you don't alreay have one, you can sign up free for a trial with credit:

* Goto [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/)
* Walk through the registration process. You will need to supply a valid credit card, but it won't be charged unless you choose to alter the default payment settings.
* Make a note of your Azure login details as we will be using them during the workshop.
