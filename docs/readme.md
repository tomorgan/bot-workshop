# Skype Bots Workshop

[Review the Prereqs](prereqs)

Is this workshop for you?

You should be a competent .NET programmer, although decent programmers from similar languages will likely do just fine. You should be comfortable in Visual Studio and understand how to work with REST APIs.


Installed already on your laptop:
------------
* Visual Studio (TODO: link, once tested with community)
* [Postman extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en)
  * Alternatively, [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) is a good substitute
  
Downloaded but not installed (we'll cover installation steps in the workshop):
------------
* [Bot Template](aka.ms/bf-bc-vstemplate)
